# Dytype

An almost-dynamically-typed, Turing-incomplete, Lisp subset. If Robert Harper's
perspective on untyped languages is that they are unityped—and if the simply
typed lambda calculus, in its simplest form, is a language with two types, and
thus achieves strong normalization—what if we brought strong normalization to
something like Lisp, by imposing a dichotomy between functions and everything
else? (Obviously the language looses much power, but strong normalization is
also a very desirable property from a certain point of view.) An experiment.
